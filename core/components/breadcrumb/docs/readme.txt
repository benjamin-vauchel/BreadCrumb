Breadcrumb is a snippet for MODx Revolution, inspired by the Jared's BreadCrumbs snippet.
It will create a breadcrumb navigation for the current resource or a specific resource.

This snippet support most of Jared's BreadCrumbs features :
	- maxCrumbs
	- pathThruUnPub (now as showUnPub)
	- respectHidden (now as showHidden)
	- showCrumbsAtHome
	- showCurrentCrumb
	- showHomeCrumb

And add new features :
	- chunk as templates (properties &containerTpl, &currentCrumbTpl, &linkCrumbTpl, &maxCrumbTpl)
	- breadcrumb for specific resource (property &resourceId)
	- direction (property &direction)
	- showContainer property
	- useWebLinkUrl property
	- scheme property

Some features of Jared's BreadCrumbs are missing but easily can be replaced by chunk / CSS customization, as :
	- crumbSeparator
	- currentAsLink
	- descField
	- homeCrumbDescription
	- homeCrumbTitle
	- maxDelimiter
	- titleField
